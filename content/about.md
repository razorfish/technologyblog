The Razorfish technology blog captures interesting trends, challenges, topics, and projects that our technologists across the network are involved with. You will see contributions from members throughout the global technology community. At the foundation of what we do is our enterprise reference technology architecture supporting all the digital applications we are building. Whether that application appears on a browser, kiosk, mobile device, or on your living room TV, we use the enterprise architecture behind the application to enable that content and transactions are available.
