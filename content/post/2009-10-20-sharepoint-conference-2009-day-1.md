I'm at the SharePoint Conference in Vegas this week. Registration and Exhibit Hall started Sunday night, but sessions officially started Monday. I am tweeting all day during the conference, follow me ([@mmdeluna](http://twitter.com/mmdeluna)) if you are interested. You can track tweets using [#spc09](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=spc09). I will be posting daily summaries. Stay Tuned!

**Registration and Exhibit Hall**

This year's conference is SOLD OUT. Compared to last years 3,800 attendees, this year's 7,400 attendance is a testament to how big SharePoint has been adopted in the enterprise. Registration was pretty well organized and the badges are smart cards that are being scanned (optionally) by vendors for mailing list subscriptions and contests; and are also scanned by event managers for session attendance. Most of the vendors I saw in the Exhibit Hall are from Document Management Services - scanning, annotating, encrypting, converting, etc. And then there are the normal partner vendors: ISVs, SIs, Training, Data Recovery, Content Migration and Professional Services. Having said that - the give aways were a bit lame :)

**Keynotes**

There were 2 keynotes scheduled on day one, which lasted the whole morning. You would think that it wasn't smart to have 7,400 attendees to sit still for almost 3 hours but Kudos to the presentation team, they pulled it off. Steve Ballmer did his FIRST SharePoint Conference keynote, one of the last few things Bill used to do that he hasn't done yet. Tony Rizzo and the others did a great job on the demos doing enough to whet the appetite of all the geeks (like me) in the room. Here are the items that "struck" me during the keynotes. I am hoping to attend some of the sessions that show these in action.



	
  * There's a HUGE emphasis on SharePoint and Internet facing sites. So much so that MS has renamed their products and services to emphasize this. Expect licensing prices to reflect this change

	
    * Intranet Products: MS Sharepoint Foundation 2010 (formerly known as WSS), MS SharePoint Server 2010, MS Fast Search Server 2010 for SharePoint

	
    * Internet Products: MS SharePoint Server 2010 For Internet Sites (STD, ENT editions) and MS Fast Search Server 2010 for Interet Business




	
  * Oh yeah - Steve Ballmer features [Kraft Foods](http://www.kraftrecipes.com/home.aspx) on his keynote - Nice! I wonder if this will drive attendance on our session (Wednesday, 10/21 @ 1:15 pm)

	
  * SharePoint 2010 goes on public beta in November - don't forget to download

	
  * SharePoint Online (SharePoint in the Cloud)

	
  * SharePoint Workspaces (Groove Makeover)

	
  * SharePoint Composites - I need to know more about this.  Interesting.

	
  * Developer tool integration in VS 2010. One-Click build, deploy and debug >> AWESOME!

	
  * Powershell Scripting - say goodbye to STSADM

	
  * New External Content Type / BCS (formerly BDC) - opens up possibilities with integration to backend systems. I'm very excited about this

	
  * SharePoint Service Applications - say goodbye to SSP

	
  * Improved List Performance and Caching - taxonomy navigation (tags and labels)

	
  * New and Improved Central and Site Admin UI - it's AJAX yo!

	
  * Built in Spell Checker - it's the little things...

	
  * Our PLDs and PLAs will like the improved support on standards specially WCAG

	
  * Some Social Computing features out of the box - ratings, notes/comments, blogs, wall (My Network)

	
  * VS 2010, SharePoint 2010 running on Windows 7 - 64 bit mobile development machine. yay!


Steve made a point by saying he didn't think there's any software out there that competes directly with SharePoint. Jeff Teper implies the same when he compares SharePoint to a Swiss Army Knife. Both videos are available online for viewing at the [SPC09](http://mssharepointconference.com) website.

The list just goes on and on! There are way too many things to get excited about in 2010. I am hoping to get into the details of a lot of these in the upcoming sessions.

**Day 1 Sessions**

For the breakout sessions on day 1, I selected a couple of SharePoint overview topics.  One was **SharePoint 2010 Overview and What's New** and more specifically for developers, **Visual Studio 2010 SharePoint Developent Tools** overview.  These sessions give me enough information on the overall features available so I can make a more informed selection in the coming days.
