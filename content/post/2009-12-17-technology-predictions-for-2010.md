Publicis Sapient's Matt Johnson outlined his predictions for content management over at our CMS blog, [www.cmsoutlook.com](http://www.cmsoutlook.com/). Many of his predictions will hold true for web technology at large as well. I see traction and opportunities for:




  * **Cloud Options:**We will see further movement towards cloud solutions, and more vendors providing SaaS alternatives to their existing technologies. It ties into the need for flexibility and agility, and the cost savings are important in the current economic climate.


  * **APIs and SOA:**Functionality will be shared across many web properties, and the proliferation of mini apps and widgets will content. APIs are becoming a critical element of any succesful solution. This is also driven by the increased complexity of the technology platform. Solutions we now develop frequently incorporate many different technologies and vendors, ranging from targeting and personalization to social capabilities. 


  * **Open Source:**Not only in content management, but in many other areas, Open Source will start to play an important role. Examples are around search, like Solr, or targeting with OpenX. Cloud computing also further drives the expansion of Open Source. As companies are looking to leverage cloud solutions for agility, the licensing complications with commercial solutions will drive further open source usage.


What do you see as additional trends?
