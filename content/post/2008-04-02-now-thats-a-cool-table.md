We worked with AT&T and the Surface folks to build this desktop application that will be showing up in AT&T locations across the company. Some of the fun features will be the interactive map, real-time phone comparisons by placing two phones on the table and lots more. We built the application using .Net 3.5 and the Windows Presentation Framework for the core application. For back-end connectivity we leveraged the Windows Communication Framework and linq. Check out the video below.``
