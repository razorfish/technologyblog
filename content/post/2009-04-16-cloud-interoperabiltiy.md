It's great to see cloud computing pushing for deep interoperability. This [MSDN post](http://blogs.msdn.com/stevemar/archive/2009/03/26/moving-toward-an-open-process-on-cloud-computing-interoperability.aspx) covers some interesting topics around the manifesto and also speaks a bit about some interesting demos showing integration between Google's App Engine and [Azure](http://www.microsoft.com/azure/default.mspx). Very excting.

"At [MIX](http://www.visitmix.com/), we highlighted the use of our Identity Service and Service Bus with an application written in [Python](http://www.python.org/) and deployed into [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/) which may have been the first public cloud to cloud interop demo."
