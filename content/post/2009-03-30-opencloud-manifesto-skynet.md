Exciting to see folks pulling together some Cloud Computing standards to help us live  seamlessly across the different [cloud vendor offerings](http://opencloudmanifesto.org/index.htm). I heard it first on the [This Week in Tech](http://www.twit.tv/) podcast, it's starting to sound a lot like the Terminator's version of [Skynet](http://terminator.wikia.com/wiki/Skynet). Get it, clouds, skynet... Anyway, iIt seems like this should be a requirment for redundancy, not to mention the ability to move based on  feature needs. Yes, sure, Cloud Computing is inherently redundant, but only across one vendor. It'll also help us realize the best value and features quickly. I think the other thing it shows is that there is a lot of room for competition. It won't just be the big players out there.

The manifesto itself was also interestingly absent of any of the big players. A quick glance at the manifesto and it's refreshingly light, which is good. It seems to think more standards are on the way, which may or may not be a good thing. I think there are lots of lessons to be learned from standards like Corba or ws-deathstar. All in all good news and a recognition that the clouds are moving quickly.
