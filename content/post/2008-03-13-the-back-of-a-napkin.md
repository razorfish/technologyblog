Often times we spend significant time caught up with diagrams and illustrations of our enterprise technology architectures, patterns, and concepts. Most recently a couple of us have been spending time on some diagrams to help illustrate the concept of a content management bus to help a large organization better share and tag their content. It's definitely an critical and fun skill. A former collegue, [Dan Roam](http://www.digitalroam.com/), has just published a book, [**The Back of the Napkin: Solving Problems and Selling Ideas with Pictures**](http://www.amazon.com/Back-Napkin-Solving-Problems-Pictures/dp/1591841992/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1205442740&sr=8-1)**.** Having worked with Dan for years, I can tell you his ability to use visual thinking to help communicate complex business and technology concepts isÂ just incredible. I just ordered a couple of copies and I am eagerly awaiting them from Amazon. Especially since I'd love some ideas on how to better help folks think about this content services bus we are working on:)...
