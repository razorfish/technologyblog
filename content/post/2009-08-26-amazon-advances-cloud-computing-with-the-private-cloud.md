Amazon Advances Cloud Computing with the introduction of a [private clould](http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/). The economics really are powerful enough to force business to take note. Anecdotally I've spoken to several highly functional startup web application using the clould succesfully. WIth the advent of more secure private clouds I don't see how enterprise can stay away much longer.
