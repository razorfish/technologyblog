[This post ](http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/08/social-networks-overtake-search-engines-in-uk-%E2%80%93-should-google-be-worried/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+Techcrunch+(TechCrunch)&utm_content=Google+Reader)makes it clear that we need to think beyond just SEO when building web properties. If you think about it, SEO and now also integrating with Social Networks is probably the most important thing you can do for your digital property. If you are building a site that no one can find, what's the point. I do think social will help grow you link popularity, at least tangentially. At the end of the day, link popularity is a factor in organic SEO anyway.
