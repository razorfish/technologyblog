A web seminar Google held at [KMWorld Magazine](http://www.kmworld.com/webinars/details.aspx?eventid=276) offered a great deal of insight into how Google manages projects and communication internally. The presentation by Google followed an employee through his first few weeks at the company, explaining the many tools he’s using: from the Google intranet MOMA, the Google Ideas site and Google Caribou Alpha, to Google Experts Search, “Googler Search,” and Google Apps.

Here are a few links to view the content of the presentation:
