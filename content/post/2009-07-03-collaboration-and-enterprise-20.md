AIIM ([www.aiim.org](http://www.aiim.org/)) non-profit organization for enterprise content management (ECM) has released a report on how “[Collaboration and Enterprise 2.0](http://www.aiim.org/Research/Collaboration-Enterprise20-Research.aspx)” is gaining importance among business.

According to this AIIM report, there has been a dramatic increase in the understanding of how Web 2.0 technologies such as wikis, blogs, forums, and social networks can be used to improve business collaboration and knowledge sharing, with over half of organizations now considering Enterprise 2.0 to be "important" or "very important" to their business goals and success. Business take up of Enterprise 2.0 has doubled in the last year.
**
Here are some key findings:**



	
  * Knowledge-sharing, collaboration and responsiveness are considered the biggest drivers.  
  


	
  * Lack of understanding, corporate culture and cost are the biggest impediments.  
  


	
  * 71% agree that it’s easier to locate “knowledge” on the Web than it is to find it on internal systems.  
  


	
  * 40% feel it is important to have Enterprise 2.0 facilities within their ECM suite, with SharePoint Team Sites as the most likely collaboration platform.  
  


	
  * Only 29% of organizations are extending their collaboration tools and project sites beyond the firewall.  
  


	
  * As regards governance of usage and content, only 30% of companies have policies on blogs, forums and social networks, compared to 88% who have policies for email.

	
  * Whereas almost all companies would not dream of sending out un-approved press releases or web pages, less than 1 in 5 have any sign-off procedures for blogs, forums and even the company’s Wikipedia entry.  
  


	
  * Planned spending on Enterprise 2.0 projects in the next 12 months is up in all product areas. 


**About 47% companies opted for SharePoint as a collaboration platform**

SharePoint is leading the Enterprise 2.0 revolution by providing a comprehensive business productivity platform that combines traditional collaboration solutions with newer social-computing technologies in an enterprise-capable product. Using rich blog, wiki, RSS, mashup and social-networking solutions combined with the enterprise content management and search capabilities of SharePoint, SharePoint customers are well positioned to deliver real Enterprise 2.0 solutions today.

Companies can use social tool plug-ins like [Socialtext](http://www.socialtext.com), [Atlassian Confluence](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/), and [Connectbeam](http://www.connectbeam.com/) (among with many others) to add more advanced SharePoint social features.

More information about SharePoint Server social-computing is available on [Microsoft's website](http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/capabilities/collaboration/overview.mspx)
