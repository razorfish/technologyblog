We just announced a new offering with our social-media partner [Pluck ](http://pluck.com/index.html)and their product code-named AdLife. AdLife will inject social media features like  customer comments and [user-generated content](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content) into digital advertisements such as  banner ads or micro sites - in effect, turning mainstream ads into social media  opportunities distributed across the digital world.

From a technology community perspective we have worked with Pluck on several  clients to bring social media features to client's websites. Plucks services are available through [software as a service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) which enables us to drive faster solutions for our clients. The are some key elements such as dealing with a AJAX/Flash/Silverlight integration and still enabling [SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization). Unfortunately, [search engines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine) are not able to deal well with [rich internet applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Internet_application) yet, but we have some ideas on how to deal with this.

That being said, I think there's a couple of critical element to why we have to make our sites social.



	
  1. We are social beings, our sites should follow. Communities  will help us make our sites better, by adding the right metadata through comments  or confirming where we get it right or telling us where we get it wrong -  wikipedia anyone:).

	
  2. Without bringing social technologies to our client's sites, the sites we  build won't be found. Organic search engines depend on social to surface pages.  Remember google bombing? That was enabled through blogging and trackbackids, a  key aspect of social. If your site/page isn't enabled socially, it won't rank in google, live, and [yahoo.](http://www.yahoo.com/)

	
  3. Outside of [organic search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_search) people read things on the web, so they can send  them to their social graph. Again, we mush make it easy for people to connect with their social graph, so people can passively or actively tell their community about the content.


At Avenue A | Publicis Sapient, we're one of the largest buyers of online media in  the world and we're partnering with [Pluck](http://www.pluck.com/), a  social media technology vendor serving 2.5 billion impressions a month to bring  this to life. For more information read the [press  release](http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2008/8/prweb1178994.htm) or read [David Deal](http://www.superhypeblog.com/)'s  blog.
