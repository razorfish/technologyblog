With [Google Gears](http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=69197&topic=11629), [Adobe Air](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/), and [Microsoft WPF](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663326.aspx) there's definitely lots of exciting changes in the desktop application area. Using the openness of the web to crack open the 'closed' nature of regular documents that we use today. At the recent Avenue A | Razorfish Enterprise Solutions summit, Andrew McAfee asked the audience who works on documents alone. Only one person in the room of 70Â  people raised the hand (still not sure why:)). The point is that we collaborate on everything we do and the traditional method of document revisions and changes is much slower than real-time changes and updates ala wiki style technology. The challenge is applying that to all the tools we use on a daily basis. How can we make code changes more collaborative and less of a check-in, check-out, merge model?
