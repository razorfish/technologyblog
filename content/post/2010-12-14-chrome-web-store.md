Last week, Google released the Chrome Web Store. Not all reactions were overwhelmingly positive, but having played with it for the last week, I like it. Even though in some cases the 'apps' are not much more than mere links to various web applications, in others, the applications are quite unique and different from the standard web sites. Having one single place to browse for new apps is a fun activity. The fact that the applications show up in my browser when I launch a new instance is very convenient. 

It is going to be interesting to see how this further evolves, but as this [engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/10/chrome-web-store-html5-and-the-ipad-symbiosis-at-its-best/) article describes, it is sure to result in further UI innovations.
