Razorfish's [Emerging Experiences](http://emergingexperiences.com/) team is using Microsoft Kinect to create new natural experiences. These natural experiences bring computing power to a larger and larger audience. Combined with the adoption of touch on smart phones, plus the large format, physical experiences continue to benefit from digital augmentation. We've been really impressed with the Kinect SDK(from Primesense), as EE Technology Director Steve Dawson mentioned it's been better at recognizing hands than other gesture technologies. Since the hand can take so many forms it's hard to recognize. Once you recognize the hand, people can naturally take control, kind of like a orchestra conductor.
