So, during the historic exciting inaugaration yesterday, many of the big folks seemed to ['melt' down](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/21/the-day-live-web-video-streaming-failed-us/) as I like to put it. Poor quality video, audio not synced, etc. I am sure there were lots of folks rebooting servers to try and keep up, but it just didn't seem to work. While [Akamai](http://www.akamai.com/) and others [streamed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media) millions of streams, up to 5.4 million simultaneous viewers per minute, there were still poor experiences. It really feels like we need to do a better job of [peer to peer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) streaming as a more efficient long term solution. [Joost](http://joost.com) was heading down that route, but it sounds like they pulled their peer to peer when they went to the in browser player. I did watch some of the inaugaraion on Joost and it worked great by the way. I also read a mention of a new technology from a company called [RayV](http://www.rayv.com/) which looks promising. The premise being, as more people watch the quality increases. Even though the company is called RayV I have no affiliation:)....
