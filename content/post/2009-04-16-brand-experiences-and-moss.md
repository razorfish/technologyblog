All the video's for the 2009 MIX conference are posted online ([http://videos.visitmix.com/MIX09](http://videos.visitmix.com/MIX09)) and they are interesting for anybody developing on the Microsoft platform. One of the session posted is about developing consumer facing brand sites, presented by Tony Jones, Technology Director for Razorfish. It touches on the unique challenges that an user experience driven company like Razorfish faces when leveraging MOSS for their web experiences, and outlines approaches on addressing these. Highly recommended. [How Razorfish Lights Up Brand with Microsoft SharePoint](http://videos.visitmix.com/MIX09/C19F)
