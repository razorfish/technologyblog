Back in April, Atlanta hosted the fifth annual Razorfish technology summit. We explored how Gesture, Mobile, and the Cloud technologies are enabling a new digital reality for consumers as well as the enterprise. The concept of a cloud-enabled app store is a revolutionary new way to deliver software to the masses across devices and platforms. Enabled by high-speed mobile connections, powerful devices and increasingly low barriers to use, these technologies will change how we interact with brands, each other and the world around us.
Here are a few videos/presentations:

[Introduction:](http://technology.razorfish.com/TechSummit2011Videos/intro/f.htm) I kicked off the day with an overview of topics discussed and the pace of technological change—and how it’s influencing the way we do business
