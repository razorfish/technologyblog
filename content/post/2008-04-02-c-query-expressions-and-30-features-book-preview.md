[Bruce Eckel](http://www.bruceeckel.com/) and coauthor Jaime King have posted a sample of their upcoming book: [C# Query Expressions and 3.0 Features](http://www.mindviewinc.com/Books/CSharp/Index.php)

 

[From the authors](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=226685):

 

<blockquote>  
> 
> It's become more common for authors to offer a few pages or sometimes a chapter of their text to the public as a means of marketing. Our aim is to not only provide a sample, but also a useful stand-alone text. By itself, this sample provides any C# 2.0 programmer a foundation in C# 3.0. 
> 
>    
> 
> This is intended to be a useful mini-book on its own, not just a teaser: it's 239 pages long and includes 82 exercises and solutions. The full book is filled with many more exercises and solutions.
