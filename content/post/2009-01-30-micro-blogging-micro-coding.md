There's a new service out there, [Snipt](http://snipt.org/), for [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) that enables folks ![](file:///C:/Users/rvelez/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot.jpg)to post code quickly. Basically, go to Snipt, cut and paste your code into the box and you get a small URL that people can go back to. Snipt takes your code and puts it into an image with a short URL. I did a quick search to see if anyone was using and found a couple of twits. Someone pointed out the incorrect usage of the alt image tech, I won't mention on which site:). Here's the [test](http://snipt.org/10c) I threw up with some C# code. Looks like fun, especially if it helps clean up some code. I guess you can use it for more than code as well.

[Tweetdeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com) is helping to identify how services like these could be more usefull, ell, the search feature on tweetdeck. For example, looking for some code to do x, setup a search in tweetdeck for x, go back to it everyone once in a while and wala, there's your solution. Well, that's the theory....
