It's really exciting to see Adobe bring together Omniture and CQ to help us build better experiences for our clients. We've been fortunate enough to work closely across our clients to help drive better experience. A big goal for us this year is to help our clients get more value out of their implementations by driving experiences that listen to what customers are telling us. Every digital interaction with a customer is an opportunity for us to learn their interests and unique asks as they interact with mobile, desktop, or any other channel experience.

The Adobe product suite is growing very rapidly, so spending time at an event like this helps us to understand the complimentary capabilities from Omniture through to CQ. Some of the highlights including



	
  * Adobe's new predictive marketing technologies enabling the future of data driving digital experiences

	
  * Rapid integration of Adobe's new tools from Context Optional and PhoneGap

	
  * The big push around data enabling all touch points from mobile and social all the way to traditional desktop
