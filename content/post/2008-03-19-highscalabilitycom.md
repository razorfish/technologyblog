A very cool site that gives us a look under the covers at what some of the super high-volume sites out there are doing to get their content and functionality to people. It's amazing to see how some of the highest volume sites out there leverage open source so effectively. [YouTube's architecture](http://highscalability.com/youtube-architecture) looks very interesting. There's also an interesting summary of the [Microsoft Cloud](http://highscalability.com/microsofts-new-database-cloud-ready-rumble-amazon) plan.
