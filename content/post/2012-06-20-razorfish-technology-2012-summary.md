The 2012 Razorfish Technology Summit was a huge success. With over 180 attendees from Razorfish, Clients, Vivaki brands, and industry thought leaders, it was our largest event to date.





Delta Air Lines executive, Bob Kupbens, kicked off the morning with an inspiring keynote on how big data enables better customer experiences.  Then our Chairman, Clark Kokich, started the afternoon by sharing his thoughts on the view from the corner office.  Throughout the day we enjoyed points of view ranging from the impact of Responsive Design to learnings from our work with Special K. Razorfish’s Rafi Jacobi closed the day with his insightful vision on the future technologies.



And since it all does really boil down to code, we added workshops so participants could get their hands dirty with Adobe and Rackspace, Amazon Web Services, Google’s App Engine and Razorfish Scrum for Teams.  A very special thanks to Stuart Thorne for inspiring the team to do some amazing work for charity in just three hours!

The event also coincided with the launch of the Razorfish 5 report. Check out the report here [http://www.razorfish5.com/](http://www.razorfish5.com/)
