[Cnet reports ](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10353479-52.html)today on how [Vivek Kundra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Kundra), theÂ US Chief Information Officer (CIO), is pushing for more movement into the clould computing space to help save taxpayer dollars. There are definitely huge savings with clould computing and it's getting harder and harder for enterprises to ignore. Especially with the recent announcement around [Amazon's Private Cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/), it seems like the enterprise barriers to adoption are slowly eroding away.

I did find Vivek's assertion here, hard to believe,

_"Using a traditional approach to add scalability and flexibility, he said, it would have taken six months and cost the government $2.5 million a year. But by turning to a [cloud computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) approach, the upgrade took just a day and cost only $800,000 a year."_

but not knowing all the details it might real. Six months down to one day, sounds too much like pixie dust to me!
