Believe it or not but Microsoft’s newly evolved search engine [bing](http://www.bing.com/) is nothing less than the answer of the above analogy question. You must have solved many of these analogy questions during your SAT exam. When I apply my knowledge and understanding to the question_“Windows : Mac :: Google : (?)”_, my answer is **“bing”**.




Remember when [Apple ](http://www.apple.com/)release it powerful Mac OS X operating system, almost every single pundit in the industry agreed that Mac may not be the most powerful system for productivity but it is certainly the coolest and the best for creativity. Young people care more for creativity and less for productivity. Windows simply felt old and outdated. Mac operating system took off since then and market share for Mac is still increasing at a growing rate. This time bing hits a home run. After the launch of fully revamped bing search engine (or as they call it decision engine) [Google ](http://www.google.com/)search kind of feel old and out dated.




Some people say **bing = “But it's not Google”.** I could not agree more. As Windows can never be Mac, bing can never be Google. In fact this time it is better for Microsoft to craft its own path and define its own destiny in search engine. The cool informational [home page image](http://www.istartedsomething.com/bingimages/)and vibrant brand colors have some kind of enigmatic charm. The creativity of bing may not appeal to mass population yet but as I know it many young kids simply love bing. They think bing aligns more with their taste.




While there are many features that make bing cool (and I will let you find out most of them yourself), I believe for me following are the best:












	
  * Home page image: Everyday bing has a fresh new vibrant image that simply amazes me.

	
  * Image search: Image search has never been so good. Every single query provides with an option to pick an image and do “find similar”. Additionally the in-browser searching and navigation of the images is absolutely next generation thinking.

	
  * Video search: This is where despite the ownership of “[You Tube](http://www.youtube.com/)” Google has failed to show value. Thumbnail preview in bing is simply outstanding.

	
  * Shopping: Oh the cash back program. Spend 1,000 on a gadget and get some money back to go have a ice cream this summer. J

	
  * News: Google has a strong lead in this field but bing has gone a step further by adding ability to search only blogs… I love that feature. People’s opinion matter more than journalists’ won’t you agree?









The list is simple but shinny. bing’s appeal to my creativity (which is not abundant) is noteworthy. I am an avid Google user but nowadays I go to bing for more than ½ of my search queries. It is fun and engaging. Google search results are still the best. So when I am searching for something very critical (items on which my job is dependent on :)) I still believe in Google but for everything else I go to bing…










If you have not already then just start “binging it”…
