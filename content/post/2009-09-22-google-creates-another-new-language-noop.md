[Google](http://google.com/) announced a new language called [Noop ](http://code.google.com/p/noop/)today. Â It looks pretty interesting, building on the power of spring and most notably for them, building dependency injection right into the laungage. Here's some of the highlights. As we look across the projects we are working on it's clear how important Spring has become to our architectures. It's nice to see a more formal recognition. It's always neat to see the impact of 'side projects' at Google.



	
  * Dependency injection built into the language

	
  * Testability - a seam between every pair of classes

	
  * Immutability

	
  * Syntax geared entirely towards readable code

	
  * Executable documentation that's never out-of-date

	
  * Properties, strong typing, and sensible modern standard library
