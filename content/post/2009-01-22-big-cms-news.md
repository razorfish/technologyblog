[Interwoven](http://www.interwoven.com) has been [purchased](http://interwoven.com/components/pagenext.jsp?topic=NEWS::RELEASES&dcr=components/autonomy.jsp) by [Autonomy](http://www.autonomy.com). Interwoven is definitely one of the most common CMS platforms we see at our enterprise 500 clients, interestingly much more than autonomy. Overall, this seems like a great opportunity for the two to grow market share. From a technology architecture perspective, there are a lot of great synergies that could come out of this merger. For example, publish content, update index. Or plug autonomy in to your content repository, interrogate your data and provide insights. I wonder how Metatagger fits in?
