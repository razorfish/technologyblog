Recently, the [Yahoo UI blog](http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/07/03/pulte/) recognized [Fred Welterlin](http://www.welterlin.com/) and team's outstanding work on the [Pulte Home's new site](http://www.pulte.com/). The post talks about the Yahoo UI components used and how we made the Javascript Library choice. This is typically a challenge for us given the great selection of libraries out there. It's interesting how Fred highlights one of the drivers for choosing YUI being it's usages of the Auto Complete Pattern. Congrats to Fred and team for being recognized for their great work.
