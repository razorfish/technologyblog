The [zemanta](http://www.zemanta.com) wordpress [plug-in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_%28computing%29) rocks. It looks at what you are typing and suggest images, urls, related articles and tags.Through the Zemanta API, it will also automatically recommend RDF to go along with your text. Very cool. Sure does writing posts a lot faster.
