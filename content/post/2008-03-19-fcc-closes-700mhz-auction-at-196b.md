Bidding in the FCC's 700MHz auction closed March 18, 2008, after the auction raised a record $19.6 billion over 261 bidding rounds. The winners of the spectrum have not been disclosed as yet by the Federal Communications Commission.The results of this single spectrum auction surpass the $19.1 billion combined total raised by the FCC in 68 other auctions over the last 15 years. The proceeds will be transferred to the U.S. Treasury by June 30, earmarked to support public safety and digital television transition initiatives. The spectrum auction is part of the transition to digital television that will culminate in all television signals switching from analog to digital on Feb. 17, 2009. The FCC also placed conditions on the sale of the C block spectrum, requiring the winning bidder to build an open network to which users can connect any legal device and run the software of their choice.Before the auction began in January, Google committed to meeting the minimum bid in the C block. AT&T and Verizon were also interested in the spectrum. Although the FCC did not say when the winner would be announced, the current speculation is that the FCC will release the information by the end of March or early April."The open platform will help foster innovation on the edge of the network, while creating more choices and greater freedom for consumers to use the wireless devices and applications of their choice," FCC Chairman Kevin Martin said in a statement. "A network more open to devices and applications can help ensure that the fruits of innovation on the edges of the network swiftly pass into the hands of consumers."
