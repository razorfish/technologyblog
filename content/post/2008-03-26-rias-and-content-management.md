Forrester recently published a report on [Rich Internet Applications and Content Management](http://forrester.com/Research/Document/Excerpt/0,7211,45564,00.html). The report covers some of the key topics in this area such as organic Search Engine Optimization, changes in build and release management, and how to change Content Management to better support RIA. The content for the report came from interviews across to folks managing and building sites with these technologies. Mike Scafidi's architecture around [Search Optimized Flash Architecture](http://avenuea-razorfish.com/articles/SOFA.pdf) (SOFA) gets a mention.
