We launched the [Razorfish 5](http://razorfish5.razorfish.com ) report today. We put a lot into the report and are excited to share it more broadly. In this report, we discuss the 5 technologies that are transforming businesses, including multi-touch and cloud computing. The findings are based on Razorfish's experience designing and integrating complex technologies for clients around the world.The report explores the recent advances and upcoming developments of five significant technologies. Key findings include:






	
  * Cloud      services and open APIs will become essential for social brands, making it      easier for businesses to tap into the consumer’s social graph. 

	
  * Reliance      on the cloud’s infrastructure will continue to grow as the need for      real-time scalability becomes increasingly critical for survival. 

	
  * Multi-touch      technology, which has already become mainstream in consumer devices, will      infiltrate retail and business environments so extensively that it will      become expected. 

	
  * Improved      hardware and connectivity will help mobile make the final transition into      cloud-based data that allows the user to learn the world around her in      real time. 

	
  * Agile      and iterative Web development will open new doors for innovation by      allowing developers to innovate and adjust products based on immediate      customer feedback.
