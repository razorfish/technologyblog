Tim Bray spoke at the Razorfish technology summit a couple of years ago. It looks like he's finally leaving Sun/Oracle to join Google and work on the Android platform. Android has been getting plenty of press and looks like a fun device, I've played around with a bunch. In [Tim's post](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/03/15/Joining-Google) about joining Google, he gives credit to Dave Winer for recognizing that Android is the '_platform without a vendor'._Â  That's a neat way to put it. At the end of the day, the most exciting thing to me is choice, competition, and different perspectives. We are all guessing at where the future is headed and the only way to find out is through experimentation and learning.
