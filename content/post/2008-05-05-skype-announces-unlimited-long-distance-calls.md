[Skype announced unlimited calling](http://about.skype.com/2008/04/skype_announces_unlimited_long.html) last month to over a third of the world’s population with the launch of its new calling subscriptions. The new subscriptions signal the first time Skype has offered a single, monthly flat rate for international calling to landline numbers in 34 countries.

The new subscriptions have no long-term contract. You can make calls whenever you want – at any time of the day, on any day of the week. From today, you can choose from three types of subscription – from unlimited calls to landlines in the country of your choice through to landlines in 34 destination countries worldwide.

However its not true Unlimited calling - all calls are subject to Skype's fair usage policy which is set at 10,000 minutes per month (which equates to just about 5 hours of calling per day). Calls to premium, non-geographic and other special numbers are excluded.
