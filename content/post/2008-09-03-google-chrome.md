Yesterday, Google launched its first beta version of open source web browser called [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/). Some people consider this launch as Google’s attack on [Microsoft’s IE](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/beta/default.aspx) and some regarded this launch as yet another browser to choose from. Google indirectly claims that market needed a fresh web browser. A browser that is written from scratch with a next generation thinking even though Chrome is built on [WebKit](http://webkit.org/) an existing open source web browser engine. Google’s long term strategy behind this product is unknown but I believe it is the move Google should have made long time ago.

One of my old college used to say **“Do not go under the spotlight if you cannot control the outcome on the stage”**. Google’s business is solely based on internet and its growth. Google is under the spotlight on the stage of internet play from the beginning but it had zero control on the way people got to the internet and the way browsers interpreted the web pages. With Chrome, for which I predict it will have a substantial market penetration soon, Google will gain some control on the outcome.

Apart from the business strategy aspect, Chrome browser does have some neat technology advancements. Chrome has done every effort to make browser more stable, faster, clean, simple, efficient and safe. Few things that are specifically noteworthy are:



	
  * User controlled multi process browser which creates independent browsing environment making it fast, stable, scalable and safe.

	
  * Platform independent JavaScript Virtual Machine called V8 which converts JS source into native machine code for faster processing.

	
  * Smart conservative garbage collection methods for fast JS interpretation speed.

	
  * Open source Gears for development community to create additional features.

	
  * And lastly search feature for your browser history, suggestions integration on address bar, incognito mode for private browsing, sandboxing of plug-in controls, pop-up blocker, phishing sites security warning etc


Google launched Chrome only for Windows which forced me to restart my Mac in [boot camp](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/bootcamp.html) mode with [Windows Server 2003](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx). I am eagerly waiting for a Mac version which Google has promised to launch shortly.
