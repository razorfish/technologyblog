Microsoft has [partnered](http://dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2008/03/25/237.aspx) with some of the world’s top social networks on contact data portability. Starting today, Microsoft will be working with [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/), [Bebo](http://www.bebo.com/), [Hi5](http://www.hi5.com/), [Tagged](http://www.tagged.com/) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) to exchange functionally-similar Contacts APIs, allowing them to create a safe, secure two-way street for users to move their relationships between their respective services. Along with these collaborations, Microsoft is introducing a new website at [www.invite2messenger.net](http://www.invite2messenger.net/) that people can visit to invite their friends from their partner social networks to join their Windows Live Messenger contact list.

The collaborations with Facebook, Bebo, Hi5, LinkedIn and Tagged will make it easier, safer, and more secure for people to have access to their contacts and relationships from more places on the web. These networks will be adopting the Windows Live Contacts API instead of “screen-scraping.”  Starting today, you can visit [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com/) and [www.bebo.com](http://www.bebo.com/) to find your friends using the Windows Live Contacts API.  Hi5, Tagged and LinkedIn will be live in the coming months.
