As we have moved into the Publicis umbrella there have been a lot of things to be excited about. Being part of Microsoft was amazing, we grew our skills and made lasting relationships. Our strong technology agnostic skills in Java, LAMP, have grown even stronger adding depth in .Net as well.  As always we search for the right technology to solve business challenges.

In my new role as CTO of Razorfish one of our first big events is the technology summit currently planned for the first week in February 2010. Publicis is clearly excited, as are we, to bring out deep technology skills to the large client base at a company the size of Publicis. Change is always change and very exciting. Below are some of the thoughts on the technology aspects of the acquisition coming out in the press and from Publicis's executives.

Here's what [Harley Manning from Forrester](http://blogs.forrester.com/customer_experience/2009/08/sold-on-publicis-groupe-buying-razorfish.html) has had to say..

_The firm has much stronger design capabilities, both for user experience and what we call “brand image”. Plus – and this is just my opinion because we did not evaluate them on this – **it[Razorfish] has stronger technology capabilities as well.**
The latter is important because there are some agencies out there with very strong tech chops, including IBM Interactive and Sapient. And it will become even more important as interactive moves to high function multi-touch mobile devices, or even stationary multi-touch devices like the way cool Coke vending machine Sapient displayed at Forrester’s recent Customer Experience Forum. Because ultimately, a great design has to actually work in order to deliver a great customer experience._

[Brandweek ](http://www.brandweek.com/bw/content_display/news-and-features/digital/e3i019254ba53a538a34ebc69a1027266fc)captured some quotes from David Kenney

_We got it at good terms," said David Kenny, managing director of VivaKi, Publicis' digital unit. They bring much more technology. I think that's important. **Their clients think very highly of them in terms of being able to technologically deliver, and that's stronger than anything we have, including Digitas."**_

In an [interview with paidContent](http://paidcontent.org/article/419-publicis-david-kenny-on-razorfish-buy-digital-revs-now-25-percent-of-to/), **Kenny pointed to Razorfish’s technology as well as its extensive global reach as key reasons behind the merge.**
