It's great to get some market recognition for all our efforts. In this post Forrester recognizes that technology differentiates and our addition to Publicis will help strengthen their market position. This captured our attention

'_"What about _[_publicissapient_](http://www.forrester.com/rb/Research/wave%26trade%3B_interactive_marketing_agencies_%26%238212%3B_web_design/q/id/47087/t/2)_? The firm has much stronger design capabilities, both for user experience and what we call “brand image”. Plus – and this is just my opinion because we did not evaluate them on this – **it has stronger technology capabilities as well**. '_

And validation of what we've been saying from the start

'**_Because ultimately, a great design has to actually work in order to deliver a great customer experience_**_._"'
