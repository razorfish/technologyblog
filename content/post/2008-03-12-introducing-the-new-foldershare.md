Yesterday, the Windows Live team released a new version of Foldershare along with their new website.

New features added are:
• A new website designed to make managing your FolderShare libraries and computers even easier.
• A new FolderShare with a better setup, a better system tray menu, and better performance on Windows Vista.
• Improvements on the backend to keep FolderShare running more smoothly and reliably.

And all this is still FREE!

You can [check out the new site](http://www.foldershare.com/), [install the new FolderShare](http://www.foldershare.com/clientdownload.aspx), and [let the team know your feedback](https://feedback.live.com/default.aspx?mkt=en-us&productkey=wlfoldershare)!
