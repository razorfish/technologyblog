Rob Scoble was the Keynote at the Fourth annual Publicis Sapient Technology Summit. He gave us an outstanding overview of what's going on with Cloud Computing and how it's impacting the digital work we do with our clients. He also challenged us to think of new ways we can leverage cloud services and cloud infrastructure for the daily work we do with clients.Thanks for a great keynote Rob. Here's his Prezi Presentation.
